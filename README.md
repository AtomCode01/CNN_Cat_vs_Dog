# README - Deep Learning Model Training Pipeline

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using PyTorch. The pipeline includes data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation with logging capabilities.

## Key Activities
1. **Data Loading:**
   - Loads the dataset (e.g., dogs and cats images) with augmentation options.
   - Splits data into training and validation sets.
   
2. **Model Definition:**
   - Implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch.
   - Uses residual blocks for enhanced feature extraction.

3. **Training Pipeline:**
   - Implements a training loop with batch processing.
   - Uses Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits Loss for classification.
   - Logs training progress using TensorBoard.

4. **Optimization & Learning Rate Scheduling:**
   - Supports Adam optimizer.
   - Optionally schedules learning rate adjustments based on validation performance.

5. **Evaluation & Logging:**
   - Computes training and validation accuracy.
   - Logs accuracy and loss using TensorBoard for visualization.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- TensorBoard

## Key Insights
- Using residual blocks improves feature learning in CNNs.
- Learning rate scheduling helps optimize convergence.
- Data augmentation enhances model generalization.
- TensorBoard logging facilitates performance monitoring and debugging.

## Running the Pipeline
### Prerequisites:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy tensorboard
```
### Training the Model:
```bash
python train.py logdir --batch_size 128 --n_epochs 10 --optimizer "optim.Adam(parameters)" --schedule_lr
```

## Output
- Model training logs are stored in TensorBoard.
- The trained model is ready for inference or fine-tuning.
